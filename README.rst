SublimeCodeIntel3
=================

This fork is mainly meant to be a refinement of the wonderful `SublimeCodeIntel <https://github.com/SublimeCodeIntel/SublimeCodeIntel>`_ plugin.
This is for Sublime Text 3 only.
It was developed with a focus on PHP, Python and JavaScript. Bug reports (for all languages), PR and general feedback are welcome!
If you're coming from the original SublimeCodeIntel, take a close look at the ``Configuring`` and ``What's New`` sections below!

---------------------------------------

Code intelligence plugin ported from `Open Komodo Editor <http://www.openkomodo.com/>`_ to `Sublime Text <http://www.sublimetext.com/>`_.

Supports all the languages Komodo Editor supports for Code Intelligence (CIX, CodeIntel2):

    JavaScript, Mason, XBL, XUL, RHTML, SCSS, Python, HTML, Ruby, Python3, XML, Sass, XSLT, Django, HTML5, Perl, CSS, Twig, Less, Smarty, Node.js, Tcl, TemplateToolkit, PHP.

Provides the following features:

* Jump to Symbol Definition - Jump to the file and line of the definition of a symbol.
* Imports autocomplete - Shows autocomplete with the available modules/symbols in real time.
* Function Call tooltips - Displays information in the status bar about the working function.

Plugin should work in all three platforms (MacOS X, Windows and Linux).


Installing
----------

**Without Git:** Download the latest source from `GitHub <http://github.com/wizza-smile/SublimeCodeIntel3>`_ and copy the whole directory into the Packages directory.

**With Git:** Clone the repository in your Sublime Text Packages directory, located somewhere in user's "Home" directory::

    git clone git://github.com/wizza-smile/SublimeCodeIntel3.git


The "Packages" packages directory is located differently in different platforms. To access the directory use:

* OS X::

    Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Browse Packages...

* Linux::

    Preferences -> Browse Packages...

* Windows::

    Preferences -> Browse Packages...


Using
-----

* Start typing code as usual, autocomplete will pop up whenever it's available. SublimeCodeIntel will also allow you to jump around symbol definitions even across files with just a click ..and back.

  For Mac OS X:
    * Jump to definition = ``Control+Click``
    * Jump to definition = ``Control+Command+Alt+Up``
    * Go back = ``Control+Command+Alt+Left``
    * Manual Code Intelligence = ``Control+Shift+space``

  For Linux:
    * Jump to definition = ``Super+Click``
    * Jump to definition = ``Control+Super+Alt+Up``
    * Go back = ``Control+Super+Alt+Left``
    * Manual Code Intelligence = ``Control+Shift+space``

  For Windows:
    * Jump to definition = ``Alt+Click``
    * Jump to definition = ``Control+Windows+Alt+Up``
    * Go back = ``Control+Windows+Alt+Left``
    * Manual Code Intelligence = ``Control+Shift+space``

Don't despair! The first time you use it it needs to build some indexes and it can take more than a few seconds.

It just works!


Configuring
-----------
Basic settings can be configured in the User File Settings.

All settings can be overridden in the *.sublime-project file under the value "codeintel_settings". For Example::

    {
        "codeintel_settings":
        {
          "codeintel_database_dir": "~/.codeintel/databases/myProject",
          "codeintel_language_settings":
          {
              "JavaScript": {
                  "codeintel_scan_files_in_project": true,
                  "codeintel_scan_exclude_dir": ["/min/"]
              },
        }
    }

If you put this in your *.sublime-project file, the codeintel-machine will use the given directory as its database,
scan the project folders for JavaScript source files but exclude paths that somehow match with the regular expression "/min/"


To define settings specifically for a language, use the "codeintel_language_settings" setting. Example::

    {
        "codeintel_settings":
        {
            "codeintel_language_settings":
            {
                "PHP": {
                    "php": '/usr/bin/php',
                    "phpConfigFile": 'php.ini',
                    "codeintel_live": true
                },
                "Perl": {
                    "perl": "/usr/bin/perl",
                    "codeintel_tooltips": "popup"
                },
                "Ruby": {
                    "ruby": "/usr/bin/ruby",
                    "codeintel_word_completions": "buffer"
                },
                "Python": {
                    "python": '/usr/bin/python',
                    "codeintel_scan_extra_dir": ["dir/one", "dir/two"]
                },
                "Python3": {
                    "python3": '/usr/bin/python3',
                    "codeintel_selected_catalogs": ["PyWin32"]
                }
            }
        }
    }

This is an extreme example, but should give you an impression of the flexibility of the language settings.

For adding additional library paths (django and extra libs paths for Python or extra paths to look for .js files for JavaScript for example), either add those paths as folders to your project, use the "codeintel_scan_extra_dir" setting.
It is recommended to configure this setting on a "per-language" basis, as a great number of import dirs will slow down the autocompletion process.



Do NOT edit the default SublimeCodeIntel settings. Your changes will be lost when SublimeCodeIntel is updated. ALWAYS edit the user SublimeCodeIntel settings by selecting "Preferences->Package Settings->SublimeCodeIntel->Settings - User". Note that individual settings you include in your user settings will **completely** replace the corresponding default setting, so you must provide that setting in its entirety.

Available settings:

* Information for all possible settings is available in the ``SublimeCodeIntel.sublime-settings`` file in the package.


Troubleshooting
---------------

To force re-indexation of the code intelligence database you need to follow these steps:

* Close Sublime Text

* Open a terminal or navigate through your directories to find the database directory (default:``~/.codeintel``) that contains ``codeintel.log``, ``VERSION`` and the directory ``db``. In Windows, this should be at ``%userprofile%\.codeintel``.

* Delete the whole directory and all of its content.

* Start Sublime Text and enjoy a clean re-indexing!
